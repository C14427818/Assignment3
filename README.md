# Assignment3
Last assignment

For my last Assignment, I have decided to make the old tron game.

Pretty simple just keep changing direction to block your opponent in.
Computer will also try and block you in first one to crash loses.

I have put up the code that I wrote in processing aswell.

The code for the IDE is in the assignment 3 folder.
